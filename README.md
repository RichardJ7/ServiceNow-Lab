- [Getting Started with ServiceNow](https://www.loom.com/share/f7445753be2e4421b9dde7523df44862)
<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of utilizing a developer instance of ServiceNow to explore and create tickets within ServiceNow. The purpose of the lab is to gain familiarity with the popular ticketing platform while gaining experience in navigating the interface of tickets. 
<br />


<h2>Creation of Developer Instance </h2>
Lab begins with first creating an account to begin the free developer instance of ServiceNow. I utilized Google to search for an accessible site that would allow me to replicate ServiceNow. The exact search which yielded the results was ServiceNow developer instance free. After accessing this, I created an account so that I can now emulate what it would resemble to work with ServiceNow.

<h2>Types of Tickets </h2>
After navigating to the incidents page, I am able to explore ticket interface and navigate the interface and search options to search the various types of tickets that can be created. I am able to see that additionally, I can update the status of the tickets directly from the interface and resolve these tickets.
